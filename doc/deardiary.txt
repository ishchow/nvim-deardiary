- Custom frequencies of journal entries (ex. can add quarterly frequencies)
- Control filesystem paths of new entries
- Templating of new entires

Requirements:
- neovim 0.5+
    - Currently requires latest neovim nightly since 0.5 isn't released yet

==============================================================================
2. Installation                                          *DearDiaryInstallation*

deardiary can be installed just like any other neovim plugin.

Plug: 

```
Plug 'ishchow/deardiary'
```

Packer:

``` 
use 'ishchow/deardiary' 
```

==============================================================================
3. Configuration                                        *DearDiaryConfiguration*

Configuration of this plugin is broken into two parts: journals and
frequencies.

Journals are distinct directories with a set of enabled frequencies. For
example, you can different journals for your personal life and work. You could
even have a different journal per hobby you have. At least one journal must be
configured in order to use this plugin.

Frequencies are named "objects" that configure path format and templating of a
frequency of entry either across all journals or within a specific journal.
Custom configuration of frequencies is completely optional if you are
satisfied with the defaults. So you can skip sections 3.2 and 3.3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Journals                                    *DearDiaryConfigurationJournals*

Add the following to a file under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/lua` (ex.
~/.config/nvim/lua/diary.lua)

Each journal must be located under a different directory.

Each journal must be configured with a set of frequencies for new entries
within the journal.

```lua
local config = require("deardiary.config")

config.journals = {
    {
        path = "~/journals/personal",
        frequencies = {"daily", "weekly"},
    },
    {
        path = "~/journals/work",
        frequencies = {"daily", "weekly", "monthly", "yearly"},
    },
}
```

Then, in your init.vim file, add this to use your configuration:

```
lua require("diary")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Adding Frequencies                    *DearDiaryConfigurationNewFrequencies*

Add the following to the same file the journals were configured in from the
previous section.

In this example, we are going to add a quarterly frequency that will be usable
by all journals.

```lua
config.frequencies.quarterly = {
    transform = function(curr_date, offset)
        -- Parameters:
        --     curr_date: current date as an object, see
        --                https://tieske.github.io/date/#dateObject for details
        --                on this object
        --     offset: number representing how offset to new entry
        --             Note: For this frequency (quarterly) an offset of 0 is
        --             the current quater, 1 is the next quarter, -1 is the
        --             previous quarter and so on.
        -- Returns:
        --     date of new entry as an object, see
        --     https://tieske.github.io/date/#dateObject for details about this
        --     object
        local quarter = (curr_date:getmonth() / 4) + 1
        curr_date:setmonth(3 * (quarter - 1) + 1, 1)
        return curr_date:addmonths(3 * offset)
    end,
    template = function(entry_date)
        -- Parameters:
        --     entry_date: date object representing date of new entry returned
        --                 by transform(), see
        --                 https://tieske.github.io/date/#dateObject for
        --                 details on this object
        -- Returns:
        --     string that represents default contents of new journal entry
        local quarter = (entry_date:getmonth() / 4) + 1
        local year = entry_date:getyear()
        return string.format("# Quarter %d of Year %d", quarter, year)
    end,
    formatpath = function(entry_date)
        -- Parameters:
        --     entry_date: date object representing date of new entry returned
        --                 by transform(), see
        --                 https://tieske.github.io/date/#dateObject for
        --                 details on this object
        -- Returns:
        --     Path of new entry as a string
        local quarter = (entry_date:getmonth() / 4) + 1
        local year = entry_date:getyear()
        return string.format("%d-%d", year, quarter) .. ".md"
    end,
}
```

To use your new frequency, first configure at least one existing journal to
use this new frequency (see previous section). Then, type the following in
command mode.

```
:lua require("deardiary").create_diary_entry("quarterly", 0)
```

You can create your own custom mappings and commands in your init.vim to make 
using the new frequency easier.

Additionally, we can add a new frequency that is scoped to a specific journal
instead of globally scoped.

```lua
config.journals = {
    ...
    {
        path = "~/journals/my_journal",
        frequencies = {
            "daily",
            "quarterly",
            biweekly = {
                transform = function(cdate, offset)
                    return config.frequencies.weekly.transform(cdate, 2 * offset)
                end,
                template = function(entry_date)
                    local bi_week_number = entry_date:getweeknumber(2) / 2
                    local year = entry_date:getyear()
                    return string.format("# Bi-week %d of Year %d", bi_week_number, year)
                end,
                formatpath = function(entry_date)
                    local bi_week_number = entry_date:getweeknumber(2) / 2
                    local year = entry_date:getyear()
                    return string.format("%d-%d", year, bi_week_number) .. ".md"
                end,
            },
        },
    },
    ...
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Overriding Frequencies           *DearDiaryConfigurationOverrideFrequencies*

Now that you know what the format of a frequency is (see the previous section), 
you can also easily globally override the properties of any built-in frequency 
(daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

In this example, the template and path format of monthly entries for all
journals are changed from their defaults.

Note: Changes to the frequency only apply to newly created entries.

```lua
config.frequencies.monthly.template = function(entry_date)
    -- Changes template string
    return entry_date:fmt("# %b of %Y")
end
config.frequencies.monthly.formatpath = function(entry_date)
    -- Puts all monthly entries in one folder instead of separating per year 
    -- which is the default
    return entry_date:fmt("%Y-%m.md")
end
```

Additionally, you can also override properties of a frequency for only a
specific journal. Any properties you don't specify will use the default
behaviour automatically.

```lua
config.journals = {
    ...
    {
        path = "~/journals/my_journal",
        frequencies = {
            daily = {
                template = function(entry_date)
                    -- Changes template string
                    return entry_date:fmt("# %Y-%m-%d")
                end,
                formatpath = function(entry_date)
                    -- Puts all daily entries in one folder instead of
                    -- separating per year and month which is the default
                    return entry_date:fmt("%Y-%m-%d.md")
                end,
            },
            "weekly",
        },
    },
    ...
}
```

==============================================================================
4. Usage                                                        *DearDiaryUsage*

Run the following command to set the active journal from `config.journals`.

`:DearDiarySelectJournal` or `<Leader>js`.

A menu will open up like this:

```
1    ~/journals/personal
2    ~/journals/work
Type in journal index and press <Enter> (empty cancels): 
```

Enter a number to pick the desired journal.

Then, open todays entry using:

`:DearDiaryToday` or `<Leader>jdc`.

Today's entry will be opened in a new buffer and filled with the contents from
a template.

`# Saturday, December 26, 2020`

Save the file and the contents of this buffer will be saved to:

`~/journals/personal/daily/2020/12/26.md`

Full list of commands and mappings are listed below.

==============================================================================
5. Commands and Mappings                          *DearDiaryCommandsAndMappings*

The following commands and mappings are provided by the plugin. The mappings
simply execute the commands and are provided for convenience.

Default mappings can be overriden if a mapping to the mapping name already
exists in your init.vim file.

For example:

```viml
nmap <silent> <Leader>ds <Plug>(DearDiarySelectJournal)
```

To completely disable all default mappings, add the following line to your
init.vim.

```viml
let g:deardiary_use_default_mappings = 0
```
